Design Journal for Introduction to Communication Design

Week1
-----

First week at it and we were learning already, we were introduced to a program called Atom which is a real easy to use text editor that allows you to code using Markdown which is an easy to use syntax styling method used for Github. Off the bat we were giving a task to use the program to style a PDF file the same way to the best of our ability.

Here is my attempt at using Markdown to copy the PDF file:
##Ireland's rugged coast yields
#Priceless Relics of the Spanish Armada
##by Robert Sténuit

A WILD NORTH WIND lashed the galleass as she sailed eastward across the top of Ireland. A monstrous wave had smashed her jury rudder; now she yawed and rolled in the troughs, making relentless leeway toward night-hidden cliffs to starboard.

>>##“In 1588 a ship of the Spanish Armada, the *Girona* was wrecked with the loss of almost all her company at a little cove near the *Giants Causeway* still called *Port na Spaniagh*, ‘the port of the Spaniards’.”

Ahead, not thirty miles away, lay Scotland's west coast and sanctuary for the vessels company, survivors of Spain's once arrogant Armada. A few more miles and the *Girona* would be clear of Ireland; a few more hours would make good an escape begun nearly three months before. Oarsmen battled the wind with flailing sweeps, struggling vainly to steer the ship away from the shore.

The wind won. White water boiled off the starboard bow. A scream from the lookout brought sailors racing to drop anchor. Too late. A fang of rock rising from the sea ripped the *Girona's* flank; she gutted herself upon it. Her back broke, her side opened, her entrails burst from her. Cannons, cannon balls, small arms, stores, coffers and 1,300 sick men, too exhausted to struggle, sank into the convulsive surf.

**Four centuries later the shipwreck was discovered under 30 feet of icy water, treasures lost on that fateful day included:**

+ A ornamental winged salamander
+ Gold cross of the Knight of Malta
+ Gilded brass dolphin
+ Lapis lazuli cameos
+ Silver sculpture of a grotesque face.
+ Gold ducats

__The Author:__ Veteran Belgin dicer Robert Sténuit spent two days at 432 feet beneath the sea in a pioneering test he described in __“The Deepest Days”,__ National Geographic, April 1965. Here he tells the dramatic story of finding the Girona.

##GitHub

We started to take a look at [GitHub](http://www.github.com) which is essetnially a huge code sharing service, we were introduced to this by [Tim](https://github.com/timpotter) and he gave us a brief overview of how to use it. The first thing we needed to do was edit a personal page that Tim had already created for use and style it to our own desire and fill it with our own information.

Having a previous experience in writing code I had an understanding in how to edit the page to my own liking and also how to link the icons to my own personal pages.

This is what the page looked like before I started editing along with the code:

After I finished editing the code my page looked a bit different:
